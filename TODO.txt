Problems:
Class renderer structure.


TO DO:
Ð¡reate a base class Renderer that will be inherited by other classes (DeferredRender, ForwardRender). Create class RenderManager that will lead all rendering process.

Optimize class Quad
Pass debugging quads from Rederer to GUI
To make textures vector and meshes vector using polymorphic classes

Unique blur for all blur needs (bloom, SSR, SSAO)
Lights at forward rendering 
Environment 
To pass to JSON format and to make loader for collection files 
To change vector objModels to vector geometry that containes all types of geometry
