Sun shadow: Take from the prefilter map null if the reflection vector equals the direction of the sun.
Create shadow map(no depth map) with possibility of postprocessing before using.
SSR: The previous frame image may be better, if it is equal to fragColor and after rendering mips for previous frame.

Chcking for uniqueness of txtures and gometris when adding.
Render textures, framebuffers, renderbuffers - classify everything
Ð¡reate a base class Renderer that will be inherited by other classes (DeferredRender, ForwardRender). Create class RenderManager that will lead all rendering process.


Pass debugging quads from Rederer to GUI
Checking for uniqueness of adding objects
To make textures vector and meshes vector using polymorphic classes


To pass to JSON format and to make loader for collection files 
To change vector objModels to vector geometry that containes all types of geometry

prefilterMap: make GUI for SANPLE_COUNT
Is it necessary to make a colletcion of environments?
